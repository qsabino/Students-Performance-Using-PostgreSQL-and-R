## Student Performance & Academic Insights
Edulytics is a data-driven project designed to analyze student academic performance using R and PostgreSQL. It integrates demographic, course, and grade data to uncover insights into GPA trends, course difficulty, and educational outcomes.

### 1. Project Overview
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database with tables for students, scores, courses, and enrollments.
- **Data Import**: Student demographic and score data loaded from CSV; course and enrollment data simulated in R.
- **SQL & R Integration**: Queries written in SQL executed via R to analyze and visualize academic trends.
- **Analytics Performed**:
  - GPA calculation and prediction
  - Course load vs GPA correlation
  - Grade distribution by department
  - Enrollment trends
  - Pass/fail rates per course
  - Detection of top-performing and at-risk students

### 2. Key Tools & Technologies
- **R** (tidyverse, DBI, RPostgres)
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data management
- **ggplot2** for data visualization

### 3. Insights Delivered
  - Which departments grade most strictly?
  - What student demographics predict higher GPA?
  - Which courses have the highest fail/pass rates?
  - Are students with higher course loads performing better?
  
### 4. Goal
  To demonstrate how educational institutions can leverage relational databases and data science tools to track, analyze, and enhance student outcomes.
